# cozy-books

I want to build my skills with programming and combine that with my passion for reading. In the beginning this application will be very rudimentary but I plan to revise it over time after I get the basics down. This application will be for tracking which books I currently have and what my reading progress of them is - similar to GoodReads but without any social features. 

## To Do
[ ] Create mySQL database to store books that I've read, books I'm currently reading, and books that I want to read

[ ] Create simple command line interface for C.R.U.D. (Create, Read, Update, Delete) 

More to come...
